00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
For nearly a century, the enduring symbol of the University of Maryland has been a

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,680
humble diamond-backed terrapin, Testudo.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,240
Testudo first took form as a 300-pound bronze sculpture, a gift from the Class of 1933,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,560
first unveiled outside of Ritchie Coliseum.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,640
The sculpture immediately became an iconic part of campus life, and the tradition of

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,080
rubbing Testudo's nose for good luck was born.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,800
Testudo might have been too popular.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,400
The original sculpture was captured 12 times.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,840
The terp nappings launched police investigations as far away as Reno, Nevada.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,880
Hoping to keep Testudo at home, the University placed the sculpture on a pedestal and weighed

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,080
it down with 700 pounds of cement.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,880
The original statue now sits proudly outside of McKelden Library.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,920
In 1965, the Student Government Association introduced Testudo II, and this turtle could

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
really get around.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,560
The 15-foot-long mobile version appeared on national television that year, just before

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,160
a home football game against rival Penn State.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:28,240
Over the years, Testudo has taken many forms, sticking a neck out for us all.

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,640
Our fearless mascot has shown us how to lead with patience and wisdom and resilience.

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,520
No matter how the University evolves and grows over the next century, one thing is certain.

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,880
Testudo will be there to help us guide the way, fearlessly forward.
