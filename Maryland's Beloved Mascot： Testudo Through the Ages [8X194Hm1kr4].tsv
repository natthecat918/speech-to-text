0	6640	For nearly a century, the enduring symbol of the University of Maryland has been a
6640	11680	humble diamond-backed terrapin, Testudo.
11680	18240	Testudo first took form as a 300-pound bronze sculpture, a gift from the Class of 1933,
18240	21560	first unveiled outside of Ritchie Coliseum.
21560	26640	The sculpture immediately became an iconic part of campus life, and the tradition of
26640	31080	rubbing Testudo's nose for good luck was born.
31080	33800	Testudo might have been too popular.
33800	37400	The original sculpture was captured 12 times.
37400	42840	The terp nappings launched police investigations as far away as Reno, Nevada.
42840	48880	Hoping to keep Testudo at home, the University placed the sculpture on a pedestal and weighed
48880	52080	it down with 700 pounds of cement.
52080	58880	The original statue now sits proudly outside of McKelden Library.
58880	65920	In 1965, the Student Government Association introduced Testudo II, and this turtle could
65920	67840	really get around.
67840	73560	The 15-foot-long mobile version appeared on national television that year, just before
73560	78160	a home football game against rival Penn State.
78160	88240	Over the years, Testudo has taken many forms, sticking a neck out for us all.
88240	95640	Our fearless mascot has shown us how to lead with patience and wisdom and resilience.
95640	101520	No matter how the University evolves and grows over the next century, one thing is certain.
101520	106880	Testudo will be there to help us guide the way, fearlessly forward.
