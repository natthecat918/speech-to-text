00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
For nearly a century, the enduring symbol of the University of Maryland has been a

00:06.640 --> 00:11.680
humble diamond-backed terrapin, Testudo.

00:11.680 --> 00:18.240
Testudo first took form as a 300-pound bronze sculpture, a gift from the Class of 1933,

00:18.240 --> 00:21.560
first unveiled outside of Ritchie Coliseum.

00:21.560 --> 00:26.640
The sculpture immediately became an iconic part of campus life, and the tradition of

00:26.640 --> 00:31.080
rubbing Testudo's nose for good luck was born.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.800
Testudo might have been too popular.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.400
The original sculpture was captured 12 times.

00:37.400 --> 00:42.840
The terp nappings launched police investigations as far away as Reno, Nevada.

00:42.840 --> 00:48.880
Hoping to keep Testudo at home, the University placed the sculpture on a pedestal and weighed

00:48.880 --> 00:52.080
it down with 700 pounds of cement.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.880
The original statue now sits proudly outside of McKelden Library.

00:58.880 --> 01:05.920
In 1965, the Student Government Association introduced Testudo II, and this turtle could

01:05.920 --> 01:07.840
really get around.

01:07.840 --> 01:13.560
The 15-foot-long mobile version appeared on national television that year, just before

01:13.560 --> 01:18.160
a home football game against rival Penn State.

01:18.160 --> 01:28.240
Over the years, Testudo has taken many forms, sticking a neck out for us all.

01:28.240 --> 01:35.640
Our fearless mascot has shown us how to lead with patience and wisdom and resilience.

01:35.640 --> 01:41.520
No matter how the University evolves and grows over the next century, one thing is certain.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.880
Testudo will be there to help us guide the way, fearlessly forward.
